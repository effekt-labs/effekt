# Introduction

**Effekt** is a lightweight and powerful web animation platform.

Tree shakeable modular design allows you to import only what is most important for your project. It works in any front-end environment without depending on specific frameworks.

A super-friendly API and first-class TypeScript support provide an amazing developer experience. The official package comes with bundled type declarations for improved type-based auto-completion in the code editor.

The library follows modern practices and supports ESM as well as minified script-based formats. This allows flexible development without any bundlers so it will work seamlessly on a simple website, no-code web editors, or advanced node projects.

The main goal is to simplify front-end animation via the JavaScript API.
